# 🔐 SoS-2025 Cryptography Project

This repository contains the complete code and documentation for my Summer of Science 2025 project under the mentorship of Param Rathour at IIT Bombay. The project explores the **foundations, mathematics, systems, vulnerabilities, and implementations** of modern cryptographic systems.

📚 **Course**: Cryptography (CS14)  
👩‍💻 **Author**: Khushi Kucheria  
🧠 **Mentor**: Param Rathour  
🏛️ **Institution**: IIT Bombay

## 🧩 Overview

This 8-week project serves as a deep dive into classical and modern cryptography, exploring both theoretical constructs and practical implementations. Each week focused on specific cryptographic domains, from classical ciphers to post-quantum cryptography.

The final deliverable includes simulations, code implementations, attack models, and an original **Cryptography Escape Room** challenge.
