# Cryptography Project – Summer of Science (SoS)

> **Course:** CS14 – Cryptography
> **Mentor:** Param Rathour  

## Overview

This repository contains my journey through cryptography under the Summer of Science (SoS) mentorship program. The project walks through the foundations of classical cryptography to advanced topics like RSA, AES, hybrid encryption, and post-quantum cryptography, combining theoretical understanding with practical implementations.
